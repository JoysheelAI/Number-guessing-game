# 🔢 Guess the Number – Python Terminal Edition 🎮

Do you have what it takes to read a computer’s mind?  
(No you don’t. But you can try.)

This is a simple, fun, and **terminal-dripping-with-color** game where you try to guess a number between 1 and 100.  
Built with love and a lil sass by **Joysheel** 💻❤️

## 🚀 How It Works

- The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100.
- You get **10 chances** to guess it.
- After each guess, you’ll be told if it was **too high**, **too low**, or **on the money**.
- Color-coded feedback thanks to the mighty `colorama` package 🌈
